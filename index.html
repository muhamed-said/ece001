<h3>Introduction</h3>
A programming language is a notation designed to connect instructions to a machine or a computer. 
Programming languages are mainly  used to control the performance of a machine or to express algorithms. 
At present, thousand programming languages have been implemented. In the computer field, many languages need to be stated in an imperative form, while other programming languages utilize declarative form. The program can be divided into two forms such as syntax and semantics. 
Some languages are defined by an SO standard like C language.
Programming languages typically provide abstractions to describe and manipulate data structures, or to monitor the execution flow.
The functional requirement that a programming language support sufficient abstraction is represented by the abstraction principle. Often, this theory is formulated as a guideline for the programmer to use these abstractions properly.
knowing which languages are growing in popularity is vital, as these are the languages that will power tomorrows apps and solutions. As such, being able to code in these languages is the best way to secure better paying - and more innovative - work.
