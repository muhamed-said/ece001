<h3>Some Points</h3>
Two Basic Types of Computer Language
Low-Level Languages: A language that corresponds directly to a specific machine
High-Level Languages: Any language that is independent of the machine
There are also other types of languages, which include

System languages: These are designed for low-level tasks, like memory and process management
Scripting languages: These tend to be high-level and very powerful
Domain-specific languages: These are only used in very specific contexts
Visual languages: Languages that are not text-based
Esoteric languages: Languages that are jokes or are not intended for serious use
These languages are not mutually exclusive, and some languages can belong to multiple categories.
The terms low-level and high-level are also open to interpretation, and some languages that were once considered high-level are now considered low-level as languages have continued to develop.
